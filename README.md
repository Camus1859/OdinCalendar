## This project was built from scratch, I built the calendar because I wanted to gain more experience with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_JS">OOP </a>. 

## I created my own algorithim to make the calendar function. This was very difficult yet extremely rewarding. I enjoyed building this app!
